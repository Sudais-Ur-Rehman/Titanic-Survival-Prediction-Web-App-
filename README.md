# Titanic Survival Prediction Web App 🚢✨

An interactive web application built with **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, class, and fare.  
This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model deployment — turning historical data into actionable insights.

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict passenger survival using machine learning.
- **Dataset:** Titanic dataset (commonly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)).
- **Features used:** Age, Sex, Passenger Class, Fare, and more.
- **Workflow:**
  - Data cleaning & preprocessing
  - Feature engineering (encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features)
  - Model training with scikit-learn
  - Deployment as an interactive Streamlit web app
