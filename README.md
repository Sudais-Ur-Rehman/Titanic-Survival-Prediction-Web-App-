# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Web-App-
Built an interactive Titanic Survival Prediction app using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The app predicts whether a passenger would survive based on features like age, sex, class, and fare. Implemented a full ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment. A great example of turning data into actionable insights!
